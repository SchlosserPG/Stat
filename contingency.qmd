### At a Glance

-   In order to succeed in this section, you will need to learn how to create and calculate probability inside a contingency table, when we have two categorical variables, and conduct our first hypothesis test, the chi-squared test of independence. In your homework assignment for this chapter, you will put these skills into practice.

### Lesson Objectives

-   Compute probability regarding two categorical variables inside contingencies tables.
-   Calculate and interpret the chi-squared statistic for the test of independence.
-   Calculate and interpret the chi-squared statistic for the goodness of fit test.

### Consider While Reading

-   In this lesson, we move from simply describing data to making inferences. We learn about contingency tables in regards to calculating probability and are able to calculate and interpret the Chi-squared statistic for the test of independence.
-   As you read and listen to the materials for this lesson, pay attention to the concepts, and pay attention to how those concepts are applied. There are rules for calculating and combining probabilities that are important for you to know to solve the problem sets and to solve real-life problems. Take note of the applicability of the normal distribution, which is a major cornerstone for statistical analysis.

## Contingency Tables

-   A contingency table generally shows frequencies for two qualitative or categorical variables, x and y.
-   Each cell represents a mutually exclusive combination of the pair of x and y values.

![Contingency Table Example](Pictures/Ch5/ContTableEx.png "Contingency Table Example")

-   Note that each cell in the contingency table represents a frequency.
    -   In the above table, 174 customers under the age of 35 purchased an Under Armour product.
    -   54 customers at least 35 years old purchased an Under Armour product.
-   The contingency table may be used to calculate probabilities using relative frequency.
    -   First obtain the row and column totals.
    -   Sample size is equal to the total of the row totals or column totals. In this case, n = 600.

### Probability Rules

-   The addition rule refers to the probability that event A or B occurs, or that at least one of these events occurs, is the following:\
    $$P(A \cup B) = (P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
-   The complement rule refers to the probability of the complement of an event, $P(A^c)$ is equal to one minus the probability of the event.\
    $$P(A^c) = 1-P(A)$$
-   Conditional probability refers to the probability of an event given that another event has already occurred.
    -   Given two events A and B, each with a positive probability of occurring, the probability that A occurs given that B has occurred (A conditioned on B) is equals to $P(A|B) = (P(A \cap B)/P(B)$. Similarly, the probability that B occurs given that A has occurred (B conditioned on A) is equal to $P(B|A) = (P(B \cap A)/P(A)$.
-   Marginal probability refers to the probability of an event occurring $(P(A))$, it may be thought of as an unconditional probability. It is not conditioned on another event.
-   The joint probability rule is determined by dividing each cell frequency by the grand total. Joint probability refers to the statistical measure that calculates the likelihood of two events occurring together and at the same point in time.\
    $$P(A \cap B)$$
    -   For example, the probability that a randomly selected person is under 35 years of age and makes an Under Armour purchase is $P(U35 \cap UA)=174/600= .29$
-   For example, this Venn Diagram illustrates the sample space for events A and B.
-   The union of two events ($A \cup B$) is the event consisting of all simple events in A or B.

![Venn Diagram](Pictures/Ch5/Venn1.png "Venn Diagram") The intersection of two events ($A \cap B$) consists of all simple events in both A and B.

![Venn Diagram: Intersection and Union](Pictures/Ch5/Venn2.png "Venn Diagram: Intersection and Union")

-   The complement of event A (i.e., $A^c$) is the event consisting of all simple events in the sample space S that are not in A.

![Venn Diagram: Complement Rule](Pictures/Ch5/Venn3.png "Venn Diagram: Complement Rule")

### Summary Measures for a Random Variable

-   The Summary Measures of a Random Variable are consistent with our discussion of Probability in the last lesson. They are copied back here for ease of reference.

#### Expected Value

-   We can calculate the expected value, or value we think is going to occur based on the type of distribution.
    -   Expected value is also known as the population mean $\mu$, and is the weighted average of all possible values of $X$.
    -   More specifically, $E(X)$ is the long-run average value of the random variable over infinitely many independent repetitions of an experiment.
    -   For a discrete random variable $X$ with values $x_1, x_2, x_3, ...$ that occur with probabilities $P(X=x_i)$, the expected value of $X$ is the probability weighted average of the values. In the case of one random variable, that means: $$E(X) = \mu = \sum{x_iP(X=x_i)} = n*p$$

#### Variance

-   Variance of a random variable is the average of the squared differences from the mean.
    -   For a discrete random variable $X$ with values $x_1, x_2, x_3, ...$ that occur with probabilities $P(X=x_i)$, the variance is defined as: $$Var(X) = \sigma^2 = \sum{(x_i-\mu)^2*P(X=x_i)} = n*p*(1-p)$$

#### Standard Deviation

-   Standard deviation is consistently the square root of the variance. $$SD(X) = \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\sum{(x_i-\mu)^2*P(X=x_i)}}= \sqrt{np*(1-p)}$$

### Calculating Probability

-   We could calculate the statistics in this contingency table a couple of ways. First, we could manually calculate it like below.

```{r}
##Calculate Totals
TotalUnder35 <- 174+132+90; TotalUnder35 ##Total under 35 age group
Total35up <- 54+72+78; Total35up ## Total 35 and older
TotalUA <- 174+54; TotalUA ## Total Under Armour
TotalNike <- 132 + 72; TotalNike ## Total Nike
TotalAdidas <- 90 + 78; TotalAdidas ## Total Adidas
Total <- 174+132+90+54+72+78; Total ##Grand Total 
```

-   Alternatively, we could make this a matrix and use the matrix command to help us calculate the answer. This gives us all the statistics with a couple of functions and allows us to interpret from there after selecting the right information from the output.

```{r}
#Put observed values in a vector by row. 
x <- c(174, 132, 90, 54, 72, 78) 
# Turn the vector into a matrix. In this case, we had 2 rows, 3 columns, and entered the data by row. 
o <- matrix(x, 2, 3, byrow=TRUE); o
#Next, we could add the names of the columns and rows values using the dimnames() command. 
dimnames(o) <- list( c("Under 35", "35 and Older"), c("Under Armour", "Nike", "Adidas"))
o
# We can easily calculate the total from here. 
total <- sum(o); total
rowsums <- margin.table(o, 1); rowsums
colsums <- margin.table(o, 2); colsums
prob <- prop.table(o); prob # each cell represents a joint probability
rowprob <- margin.table(prob,1); rowprob #each value represents marginal probability
colprob <- margin.table(prob,2); colprob #each value represents marginal probability
```

-   Take note that when subsetting from the matrix we created above, the dimnames do not serve as a column or row. so the first number is in row 1, column 1. This is distinct from data.frames, which typically have the 1st column designated for the labels.

```{r}
prob[1,1] #corresponds to the joint probability value associated with Row 1 (Under 35), Col 1 (Under Armour)
```

-   Once we do our calculations our totals, we can ask probability questions.

-   When looking up an answer to the question, it makes it easier to reference the tables to ensure you are subsetting correctly.

```{r}
o; prob
```

-   If a person is under 35, what is the probability they will select Under Armour? $$P(UA|under35) = (P(UA \cap under35)/P(under35))$$

```{r}
# This is a conditional probability question.
174/396 #or
prob[1,1]/rowprob[1]
```

-   What is the probability of a person 35 or older randomly selecting Nike? $$P(N|older35) = (P(N \cap older35)/P(older35))$$

```{r}
# This is a conditional probability question.
72/204  # or
prob[2,2]/rowprob[2]
```

-   If the chance the preference was the same regardless of condition, how many people would you expect to select Nike? $$Ex(Nike)$$

```{r}
# This is a expected value question.
TotalNike # or
colsums[2]
```

-   We can calculate summary measures based on a variable category.

```{r}
# E(X) of 35 Years or older (formula n*p)
n <- total; n  #600
p <- rowprob[2];p #.34

n*p #Or simply the frequency for the column 35 and older

#Var(X) (formula n*p*(1-p))
varx <- n*p*(1-p); varx #134.64

# SD(X) (formula sqrt of variance)
sdx <- sqrt(varx); sdx #11.60345 
```

### Larger Contingency Table

-   The survey question asked participants in multiple groups the following question, "How likely are you to participate in the event in the future?"
-   In order to answer this question, first, lets bring in some data and calculate totals.

![Contingency Table Numbers](Pictures/Ch5/ConTblNum.png "Contingency Table Numbers")

```{r}
x <- c(197,388,230,103,137,98,20,18,18,13,58,45)
o <- matrix(x, 4, 3, byrow=TRUE); o

dimnames(o) <- list( c("Students", "Faculty/Staff", "Alumni", "Town Residents"),c("Unlikely", "Moderately Likely", "Very Likely"))
o
total <- sum(o); total
rowsums <- margin.table(o, 1); rowsums
colsums <- margin.table(o, 2); colsums
# Lets add the grand total to the colsums
colsums <- c(colsums, total); colsums
```

-   In this example, we can bind the data together so that it is a little easier to see. Examine the final table and compare that to the figure above.

```{r}
totals <- cbind(o, rowsums); totals
totals <- rbind(totals, colsums); totals
```

![Contingency Table Proportions](Pictures/Ch5/ConTblProp.png "Contingency Table Proportions")

-   Next, let's calculate probabilities.

```{r}
prob <- prop.table(o); prob
TotalRowProb <- margin.table(prob,1); TotalRowProb
TotalColProb <- margin.table(prob,2); TotalColProb
TotalColProb <- c(TotalColProb, sum(TotalColProb)); TotalColProb
```

-   In this example, we can also bind the data together so that it is a little easier to see. Again, we are trying to get our R code in the best shape to be able to select the right information to calculate probability from it.

```{r}
proportions <- cbind(prob, TotalRowProb); proportions
proportions <- rbind(proportions, TotalColProb); proportions
```

-   Now that our tables have been tabulated, we can answer some probability questions.

-   What proportion of Students participated in the survey?\
    $P_S= 815/1325$ or $0.61509434$

-   What proportion of Faculty/Staff remarked that they were Unlikely to participate?\
    $P(U|FS) = P(U \cap FS) / P(FS) = 103/338 = 0.077735849/0.25509434 = 0.3047337$

-   If a person is a Town Resident, what is the probability that they will select Very Likely?\
    $P(VL|TR) = P(VL \cap TR) / P(TR) = 45/116 = 0.03396226/0.08754717 = 0.387931$

-   What proportion of people would you expect to select Moderately Likely?\
    $P_ML = 601/1325$ or $0.4535849$. What is the expected number? $E(ML) = 601$.

-   What is the probability that a randomly selected person is a Faculty/Staff or selects Very Likely?\
    $P_FS + P_VL - P_FS \cup P_VL = 0.25509434 + 0.2950943 − 0.07396226 = 0.4762264$

```{r}
# E(X) of Moderately Likely (formula n*p)
n = total; n #1325
p = TotalColProb[2];p #.45358

n*p #Or simply the frequency for the column Moderately Likely

#Var(X) (formula n*p*(1-p))
varx <- n*p*(1-p); varx #328.3955

# SD(X) (formula sqrt of variance)
sdx <- sqrt(varx); sdx #18.12
```

## Chi-Squared Test for Independence

-   Broadly, the test for independence tests whether or not two variables whose frequencies are represented in a contingency table have statistical independence from one another.

-   A test of independence – also called a chi-square test of a contingency table – is used to analyze the relationship between two qualitative variables.

-   Broadly, this test involves summing the squared differences between observed and expected values, combining the differences into an overall statistic, and then using that statistic to determine significance of the hypothesis test.\
    $\chi^2 = \frac{(observed-expected)^2}{expected}$

-   Squaring the differences before adding them up will result in a positive value that is larger when there are larger differences and smaller when there are smaller differences. This value captures the magnitude of the difference between observed and expected values.

-   In order to account for situations when the observed and expected values are very large, which could result in extremely large differences between observed and expected, the squared differences are divided by the expected value in each cell.

-   Visualizing the Chi-squared Distribution Chi-squared distribution has a single parameter, the degrees of freedom or $df$.\
    $\sqrt(2*df)$

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

gridExtra::grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4)

```

-   The Chi-squared probability density function shows the probability of a value of chi-squared occurring when there is no relationship between the two variables contributing to the chi-squared, where a large chi-square indicates a relationship between variables.
-   The competing hypotheses can be expressed as:
    -   $H_0$: The two classifications are independent.
    -   $H_A$: The two classifications are dependent.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
x5 <-data.frame(rchisq(10000, 5, ncp = FALSE))
colnames(x5) <- "value"

plot5 <- ggplot(data = x5, aes(x = value)) +

     geom_vline(xintercept = 10, color="#B9975B", linetype = "longdash", lwd=1); plot5
```

### Steps to conduct Chi-Squared Test for Independence

-   Step 1: Write the null and alternate hypotheses.
-   Step 2: Compute the test statistic.
-   Step 3: Calculate the probability.
-   Step 4: If the probability that the null is true is very small, usually less than 5%, reject the null hypothesis OR If the probability that the null is true is not small, usually 5% or greater, retain the null hypothesis.

### Assumptions of the Chi-Squared Test of Independence

-   Assumption 1: The variables must be nominal or ordinal.

-   Assumption 2: The expected values should be 5 or higher in at least 80% of groups.

-   Assumption 3: The observations must be independent.

-   Note that there are a couple of ways observations can be non-independent.

    -   One way to violate this assumption would be if the data included the same set of people before and after some intervention or treatment.
    -   Another way to violate this assumption would be for the data to include siblings or parents and children or spouses or other people who are somehow linked to one another.
    -   Since people who are linked to each other often have similar characteristics, statistical tests need to be able to account for this and the chi-squared test does not.

### Example of a Test for Independence

![Contingency Table Example](Pictures/Ch5/ContTableEx.png "Contingency Table Example")

-   Step 1: Set up the Hypothesis
    -   $H_0$: Age group and Brand Name are independent.
    -   $H_A$: Age group and Brand Name are dependent.
-   First, we bring in the data manually from the table by column. We had 3 columns, so we need to make three vectors as shown below.

```{r}
UA <- c(174, 54)
N <- c(132, 72)
A <- c(90, 78)
```

-   Then we convert these columns to a data frame. If you already have a data frame, you don't have to do this step.

```{r}
M <- data.frame(UA, N, A); M
```

-   Always make sure your data frame looks like the table.

-   Steps 2 and 3: Compute the test statistic and calculate the probability.

-   Here, we run the chisq.test() command, which only includes the columns of interest.

```{r}
chisq.test(M)
```

-   Step 4: If the probability that the null is true is very small, usually less than 5%, reject the null hypothesis versus If the probability that the null is true is not small, usually 5% or greater, retain the null hypothesis.
-   Here, our p-value is 1.282e-05, so we reject the null, $H_0$, and conclude that Age group and Brand Names are dependent.

### Example Using an Imported Dataset

-   Import the STEM data into a data frame (table) into R.
-   Step 1: Set up the Hypothesis:
    -   $H_0$: Stem field and Gender are independent.
    -   $H_A$: Stem field and Gender are dependent.

```{r}
STEM <- read.csv("data/stem.csv")
STEM
```

-   Steps 2 and 3: Compute the test statistic and calculate the probability.
-   Again, we use Rs chisq.test() command to calculate the value of the test statistic, as well as the p-value. Within the chisq.test() function, we indicate that the relevant data are in columns 2 and 3 of the data frame.

```{r}
chisq.test(STEM[,2:3]) 
```

-   Step 4: If the probability that the null is true is very small, usually less than 5%, reject the null hypothesis versus If the probability that the null is true is not small, usually 5% or greater, retain the null hypothesis.
-   Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis. At the 5% significance level, we can conclude that one’s sex does influence field choice within the STEM major.

## Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit Test

-   There are a few other tests regarding a Chi-squared distribution, and one other is the goodness of fit test.

-   This test determines whether two or more population proportions equal each other or any predetermined set of values and like the test for independence, still involves the fit between observed and estimated values.

-   A multinomial experiment consists of a series of n independent trials such that:

-   On each there are k possible outcomes.

-   The probability of falling into category $i$ is the same on each trial.

-   The $k$ probabilities sum to $1:p_1 + p_2 +⋯+p_k = 1$

-   The null hypothesis: the population proportions are equal to one another or they are each equal to a specific value.

-   For example, are four candidates in an election equally favored by voters?

-   Equal Population proportions:\
    $H_0: P_1=P_2=P_3=P_4=.25;$\
    $H_A$:Not all populations are equal to .25

-   Or, do people rate food quality in a restaurant comparably to last year?

-   Unequal Population Proportions:\
    $H_0: P_1= .4, P_2=.3, P_3= .2, P_4=.1;$\
    $H_A:$ At least one $P_i$ differs from its hypothesized value.

### Example Using Raw Numbers

-   Last year the management at a restaurant surveyed its patrons to rate the quality of its food. The results were as follows: 15% Excellent; 30% Good; 45% Fair; and 10% Poor.

-   Based on this and other survey results, management made changes to the menu.

-   This year, the management surveyed 250 patrons, asking the same questions about food quality. Here are the results: 46 Excellent; 83 Good; 105 Fair; and 16 Poor.

-   We want to know if the current results agree with those from last year, or if there has been a significant change.

-   To do this, we compute an expected frequency for each category and compare it to what we actually observe. Then, we compute the difference between what was observed and expected for each category. If the results this year are consistent with last year, these differences will be relatively small.

-   The steps are same as the Chi-Squared Test of Independence.

-   Step 1: Set up the Hypothesis:

    -   $𝐻_0$: Each proportion equals a hypothesized value.
    -   $𝐻_A$: Not all proportions equal their hypothesized values.

-   Steps 2 and3: Compute the test statistic and calculate the probability.

-   We can use R’s chisq.test() function to calculate the value of the test statistic and corresponding p-value. Within this function, we use the option p to indicate the location of the hypothesized proportions.\

```{r}
#Chi Squared Test Goodness of Fit
o <- c(46, 83, 105, 16)
p <- c(.15, .3, .45, .1)
chisq.test(o, p=p)

```

-   Note that p= is required here because it is not the second argument in the chisq.test() command.

-   Step 4: If the probability that the null is true is very small, usually less than 5%, reject the null hypothesis versus If the probability that the null is true is not small, usually 5% or greater, retain the null hypothesis.

-   At alpha = .05, we do not reject $H_0$ and cannot conclude that the proportions differ from the ones a year ago.

### Example Using an Imported Dataset

-   The steps are same as the Chi-Squared Test of Independence.
-   Step 1: Set up the Hypothesis:
    -   $𝐻_0$: Each proportion equals a hypothesized value.
    -   $𝐻_A$: Not all proportions equal their hypothesized values.
-   Steps 2 and 3: Compute the test statistic and calculate the probability.
-   First, we import the stemGOF.csv data into a data frame (table) in R.
-   Then, again, we use Rs chisq.test function to calculate the value of the test statistic and the p-value. Within the chisq.test function, we use the option p to indicate the location of the hypothesized proportions.

```{r}
STEMGOF <- read.csv("data/stemGOF.csv")
STEMGOF
chisq.test(STEMGOF$RecentNumbers,p=STEMGOF$X2010Proportions) 
```

-   Step 4: If the probability that the null is true is very small, usually less than 5%, reject the null hypothesis versus If the probability that the null is true is not small, usually 5% or greater, retain the null hypothesis.
-   Since our p-value is 0.0006441, we reject $H_0$ and conclude that the proportions differ at the 5% significance level. In this case, that means that the recent stem numbers differ from the 2010 values.

## Summary

-   In this lesson, we learned about contingency tables in regards to calculating probability with two categorical variables. We also computed the chi-squared statistics for the test of independence and the goodness of fit.
